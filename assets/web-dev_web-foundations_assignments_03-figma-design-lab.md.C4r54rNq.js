In this lab, you&#39;ll embark on a creative journey to translate design concepts into functional web interfaces. The lab is divided into two key phases: Low Fidelity Mockup and High Fidelity Mockup, followed by the implementation of your design using <code>Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS</code> .</p><h3 id="phase-1-low-fidelity-mockup" tabindex="-1">Phase 1: Low Fidelity Mockup <a class="header-anchor" href="#phase-1-low-fidelity-mockup" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Phase 1: Low Fidelity Mockup&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Your journey begins with the Low Fidelity Mockup stage. Here, you&#39;ll conceptualize the basic structure and layout of your web page based on a provided image. Utilize basic shapes to focus on layout, content placement, and overall structure. This phase encourages ideation and a clear understanding of the design elements before diving into detailed implementation.</p><h3 id="phase-2-high-fidelity-mockup" tabindex="-1">Phase 2: High Fidelity Mockup <a class="header-anchor" href="#phase-2-high-fidelity-mockup" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Phase 2: High Fidelity Mockup&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Building on your low fidelity mockup, it&#39;s time to add detail and precision in the High Fidelity Mockup phase. Become familiar with Figma as you begin to create a pixel-perfect representation of your web page. Pay attention to colors, typography, images, and any interactive elements. This stage serves as a blueprint for your final implementation.</p><h3 id="phase-3-implementation-with-bootstrap-html-and-css" tabindex="-1">Phase 3: Implementation with Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS <a class="header-anchor" href="#phase-3-implementation-with-bootstrap-html-and-css" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Phase 3: Implementation with Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now comes the exciting part—bringing your mockup to life! Using Bootstrap for responsive design, HTML for structuring your content, and CSS for styling, you&#39;ll replicate your high fidelity mockup as a fully functional website. Consider the responsiveness of your design, ensuring it looks and behaves well on various devices.</p><p><strong>Lab Objectives:</strong></p><ol><li>Develop a low fidelity sketch and high fidelity mockup based on the provided image.</li><li>Implement the high fidelity mockup using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.</li><li>Ensure responsiveness for a seamless user experience across devices.</li><li>Pay attention to details such as typography, colors, and spacing for a polished design.</li></ol><p><strong>Resources:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Get Started with Bootstrap</a></li><li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HTML Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CSS W3Schools Tutorial</a></li></ul><p>Remember, this lab is not just about coding; it&#39;s about visualizing, planning, and executing a design that captures the essence of the provided image.
