Well today that is going to change. Without any repercussions. No detention, no staying after, and most importantly no phone call to the parents.</p><p>Believe it or not but copying another&#39;s work is a great way to get practice with a skill. Anyone who has learned to play an instrument is probably familiar with playing music they didn&#39;t write. It&#39;s important that we try to replicate their work without copying it exactly. In other words, just finding their code and copying it over. There is still value in using their code when you write your own.</p><h2 id="goals" tabindex="-1">Goals <a class="header-anchor" href="#goals" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Goals&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>In this challenge your goal is to replicate the design and layout of a given website.</p><p>This challenge will likely take some a chunk of time to complete fully, and it will test you so be sure to have some patience with yourself, <mark title="Setting a hard limit on the amount of time you &#39;struggle&#39; when you run into an issue before getting help.">&quot;timebox&quot;</mark> your problems appropriately, and seek help when needed.</p><ul><li>Test your bootstrap skills by replicating its design.</li><li>Understanding of page structure.</li><li>Ability to adhere to design requirements.</li></ul><h2 id="references" tabindex="-1">References <a class="header-anchor" href="#references" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;References&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><blockquote><p><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bootstrap Intro</a></p><p><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bootstrap Grid</a></p><p><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/colors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bootstrap Colors</a></p></blockquote><h2 id="getting-started" tabindex="-1"><strong>Getting Started</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Getting Started**&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Pick <em>one</em> of the <em>four</em> sites below that you want to create. <em>click to expand</em></p><p>The best site might not be the one that interests you the most, maybe it&#39;s the one you think offers the most challenge.</p><details><summary>1. <b>Become a Leader üíª</b></summary><br><img src="https://bcw.blob.core.windows.net/public/img/bootstrap-clone.jpg"></details><details><summary>2. <b>A Pen that Does More üíª</b></summary><br><img src="https://bcw.blob.core.windows.net/public/img/stylus.png"></details><details><summary>3. <b>Go Bowling üì±</b></summary><br><img src="https://bcw.blob.core.windows.net/public/img/bootstrap-bowling-club.jpg"></details><details><summary>4. <b>Royal Breakfast üíª</b></summary><br><img src="https://bcw.blob.core.windows.net/public/img/crown-site-clone.png"></details><h2 id="build-your-site" tabindex="-1"><strong>Build Your Site</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#build-your-site" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Build Your Site**&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><h3 id="make-a-game-plan" tabindex="-1"><strong>Make a Game Plan</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#make-a-game-plan" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Make a Game Plan**&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Your first step should be building out the basic layout of the page.
