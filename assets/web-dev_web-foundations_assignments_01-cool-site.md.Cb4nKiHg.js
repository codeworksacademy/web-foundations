Try drawing some boxes on paper or in a visual app like figma or paint to visualize the different sections of the page.</p><p>Anytime you want content boxes to sit side by side, you will want to use the <code>display: flex</code> property. We can also utilize CSS dimension properties like:</p><ul><li><code>width &amp; height</code></li><li><code>min-width &amp; min-height</code></li><li><code>max-width &amp; max-height</code> as well to fit things into general locations</li></ul><p>Your focus now should just be getting the sections and content boxes into approximately the right places, don&#39;t worry too much about sizing.</p><blockquote><p>üß© You could color the background of each section using CSS to better define them.</p><p>üß© Try using a CSS rule like <code>*{outline: 1px dotted black;}</code> to get a better visualization or your boxes as you build them on the page.</p></blockquote><h3 id="filling-in-the-content" tabindex="-1"><strong>filling in the content</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#filling-in-the-content" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**filling in the content**&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Now, you can start filling out the boxes you have previously layed out.

You made to make multiple changes to your css for this to work but don&#39;t shy away from breaking things to make it better.
