Then the same for your boss. If you want to get fancy you can give each of these characters progress bars instead of numbers to represent their health but this isn&#39;t necessary. Don&#39;t forget to give these id&#39;s so they can later be targeted.</p><h3 id="attack-the-boss" tabindex="-1">Attack the Boss <a class="header-anchor" href="#attack-the-boss" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Attack the Boss&quot;">​</a></h3><p>On the boss&#39;s image, add a click attribute that will attack the boss. This method should reduce the boss&#39;s health by the COMBINED damage of the heroes. Write a loop ( or a forEach function ) to add up the heroes damage together, then reduce the the boss object&#39;s health by that number. e.g. the dwarf deals 5 and the elf deals 10, so the boss will lose 15 health.</p><blockquote><p><em>⚠️ If you are struggling on how update the value, you can do so by either replacing the entire element or simply setting the <code>.innerText</code> property of the element in after getting it in javascript.</em></p></blockquote><p>*<em>once you have this working, see if you can get the value to stop at 0 and prevent the value from going into the negatives</em></p><h3 id="the-boss-fights-back" tabindex="-1">The Boss Fights Back! <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-boss-fights-back" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Boss Fights Back!&quot;">​</a></h3><p>So that the game has some inherent risk, we want our boss to fight back. We will need to write a function that loops over our heroes array and reduces their health by the damage the boss deals. In the example this is 5. Test if this function works the way you expect it too by calling it from the browser&#39;s console. Each time you call the function the heros&#39; health should go down. Once that works set up an interval to call the this method every 5 seconds. Now the battle has begun!</p><blockquote><p><em>Once you have that working it can be fun to give the boss a bit of variable damage, either use a random number between two values or for better use in a later step, damage the heroes by the boss&#39;s damage multiplied by it&#39;s level.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>To create a losing scenario if all the heroes are reduced to 0.

Let&#39;s add some logic to our function that attacks the boss, to determine if the boss is dead ( health is less than or equal to 0 ).</p><p>When you reach the logic that the boss has been defeated, instead of preventing the health going negative, the boss can level up and the battle can begin again! Write a function that levels the boss up and heals them. Increment their level, increase it&#39;s max health then set the boss&#39;s health equal to it&#39;s new max health.

There will also need to be a global variable to hold the gold the hero has won, which can then be displayed to the DOM.</p><blockquote><p><em>As the monster levels up, consider increasing the reward as well, so the tougher monsters drop better rewards.</em></p></blockquote><h3 id="i-m-dying-here" tabindex="-1">I&#39;m Dying Here! <a class="header-anchor" href="#i-m-dying-here" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;I&#39;m Dying Here!&quot;">​</a></h3><p>After a few rounds the heroes will lose every time. Let&#39;s add a sort of &#39;health pack&#39; that the player can buy with their hard earned gold, that way we can keep our heroes alive and slaying monsters. We will need to write a function that takes in a hero&#39;s name as a <code>parameter</code>. Attach this function to some sort of onclick either on a button or on the hero themselves, that passes their name as a <code>argument</code> when you click it. Use this name to write an array <code>.find</code> method to get the entire hero object out of the heroes array with that has that name. Try console logging what you found. Is it the hero you expected? Once you have that working you can increase the hero&#39;s health.</p><p>You will want to write in the logic to check if they have enough gold before you increase their health.

Instead of one static boss there could be an array of bosses that you rotate through.
